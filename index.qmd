## Abstract

**Background:**

**Methods:**

**Results:**……

**Conclusions:**


## Introduction

### hypothesis
we hypothesize that greater housing stress will be associated with accelerated cognitive decline across multiple domains. Furthermore, I expect housing stress to differentially affect specific cognitive domains, though the pattern of domain-specific effects will be explored.



### Pragraph 1
(Why does the issue matter?)
the number of people who encounter housing instability
effect measure modification

### Pragraph 2
(what do we know about the issue?)
existing studies suggest association between housing stress and cognitive functioning such as executive function (EF) skills (Vaid, 2024)

Pragraph 3
(what do we not know about the issue?)
​​few have investigated detailed cognitive assessments such as immediate and delayed word recall, serial subtraction, and object naming tasks.
(how studying the exposure of interest could shed light on potential interventions that could help reduce the risk of the outcome. )
These specific cognitive measures are critical as they can be early markers for Alzheimer's disease and dementia (Na Chiangmai et al., 2025).

Pragraph 4
How does this paper address what we do not know?
This research addresses this gap by examining the longitudinal relationship between housing stress and multiple cognitive domains using HRS data.
