               negative consequences of poor housing quality on physical and
               mental health. Despite this increased focus on the salutogenic
               impacts of housing, the relationship between housing quality and
               cognitive health remains understudied. This study examined how
               the housing quality in urban informal settlements, where living
               conditions are often substandard, affects women's cognitive
               functioning, with a specific focus on executive function (EF)
               skills. EF is a decision-making system that enables us to make
               decisions using working memory and attentional control. This
               study addressed two key questions: (1) Is housing quality
               associated with EF skills? (2) Does perceived housing stress
               experienced by women mediate the housing-EF relationship? A
               standardized observer-based tool assessed housing quality,
               psychometric instruments measured EF skills, and a 12-item
               questionnaire evaluated perceived housing stress. Results
               indicated that better housing quality is positively associated
               with higher EF skills, with housing stress acting as a mediating
               factor in this relationship. These findings have important
               implications for both health and housing policies. Investments in
               improving housing conditions can yield cognitive health benefits

               health researchers know little about how this may impact their
               cognitive health. We investigated links between foreclosure and
               older adults' memory and probability of dementia. METHODS: Using
               the Health and Retirement Study (2008 to 2018), we fit mixed
               models comparing the memory and dementia probability scores of
               249 older adults who experienced foreclosure (treated) with
               15,645 who did not. Baseline covariates included
               sociodemographics and health. Models were stratified by age
               group. RESULTS: Foreclosure was associated with faster memory
               decline among middle-aged (50 to 64) older adults (-0.007
               standard deviations/year, 95\% confidence interval: -0.13,
               -0.001). Compared to average memory decline among middle-aged
               older adults who were stably housed, foreclosure equated to 3.7
               additional years of aging over 10 years. Among those 65+,
               differences between those who were and were not foreclosed upon
               were short-lived and less clear, potentially driven by
               depletion-of-susceptibles bias. DISCUSSION: Foreclosure may
               endanger older adults' memory. HIGHLIGHTS: Housing instability is
               a key determinant of cognitive aging. We examined foreclosure and
               levels and changes in memory and dementia probability scores in
               the US older adult population. Foreclosure was associated with
               faster memory decline among middle-aged (50 to 64) older adults,
               equivalent to 3.7 additional years of cognitive aging over 10
               years. Foreclosure yielded sharp memory declines and increases in
               dementia probability among older adults 65 and above. Foreclosure
               imposes a greater risk for older adults' cognitive decline.",

               impairment and assumed to relate to frontal lobe dysfunction.
               Performance failures on standard tests of attention and executive
               function reinforce this interpretation. Nevertheless, early-onset
               AD patients do not show the frank behavioural changes indicative
               of frontal lobe dysfunction, and the characteristic functional
               neuroimaging changes are in posterior hemispheres rather than
               frontal lobes. We explored this anomaly through a comparison of
               working memory, attention and executive test performance in
               patients with AD (a 'typical' early-onset group with deficits in
               memory, language and perceptuospatial function and an 'amnesic'
               group) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Typical-AD and FTD
               patients both showed impaired performance, whereas amnesic-AD
               patients performed well. Despite similar quantitative performance
               measures, typical-AD and FTD patients showed qualitatively
               distinct performance profiles. Impairments in FTD patients were
               interpreted in 'frontal' executive terms as deficits in

               performance appeared to be influenced by information load and was
               interpreted in terms of working memory capacity. In keeping with
               these different interpretations, neuroimaging showed
               characteristic frontal lobe abnormalities in FTD and
               temporoparietal change in typical-AD. The findings highlight the

               working memory, attention and executive test failures to frontal

               these four pillars can lead to cumulative burden by interacting
               with one another and with other structurally-rooted inequalities
               to produce and reify health disparities. We conclude by offering
               a comprehensive vision for healthy housing that situates
               housing's impact on health through a historical and social
               justice lens, which can help to better design policies and
               interventions that use housing to promote health equity.",
