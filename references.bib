               negative consequences of poor housing quality on physical and
               mental health. Despite this increased focus on the salutogenic
               impacts of housing, the relationship between housing quality and
               cognitive health remains understudied. This study examined how
               the housing quality in urban informal settlements, where living
               conditions are often substandard, affects women's cognitive
               functioning, with a specific focus on executive function (EF)
               skills. EF is a decision-making system that enables us to make
               decisions using working memory and attentional control. This
               study addressed two key questions: (1) Is housing quality
               associated with EF skills? (2) Does perceived housing stress
               experienced by women mediate the housing-EF relationship? A
               standardized observer-based tool assessed housing quality,
               psychometric instruments measured EF skills, and a 12-item
               questionnaire evaluated perceived housing stress. Results
               indicated that better housing quality is positively associated
               with higher EF skills, with housing stress acting as a mediating
               factor in this relationship. These findings have important
               implications for both health and housing policies. Investments in
               improving housing conditions can yield cognitive health benefits

               health researchers know little about how this may impact their
               cognitive health. We investigated links between foreclosure and
               older adults' memory and probability of dementia. METHODS: Using
               the Health and Retirement Study (2008 to 2018), we fit mixed
               models comparing the memory and dementia probability scores of
               249 older adults who experienced foreclosure (treated) with
               15,645 who did not. Baseline covariates included
               sociodemographics and health. Models were stratified by age
               group. RESULTS: Foreclosure was associated with faster memory
               decline among middle-aged (50 to 64) older adults (-0.007
               standard deviations/year, 95\% confidence interval: -0.13,
               -0.001). Compared to average memory decline among middle-aged
               older adults who were stably housed, foreclosure equated to 3.7
               additional years of aging over 10 years. Among those 65+,
               differences between those who were and were not foreclosed upon
               were short-lived and less clear, potentially driven by
               depletion-of-susceptibles bias. DISCUSSION: Foreclosure may
               endanger older adults' memory. HIGHLIGHTS: Housing instability is
               a key determinant of cognitive aging. We examined foreclosure and
               levels and changes in memory and dementia probability scores in
               the US older adult population. Foreclosure was associated with
               faster memory decline among middle-aged (50 to 64) older adults,
               equivalent to 3.7 additional years of cognitive aging over 10
               years. Foreclosure yielded sharp memory declines and increases in
               dementia probability among older adults 65 and above. Foreclosure
               imposes a greater risk for older adults' cognitive decline.",

               impairment and assumed to relate to frontal lobe dysfunction.
               Performance failures on standard tests of attention and executive
               function reinforce this interpretation. Nevertheless, early-onset
               AD patients do not show the frank behavioural changes indicative
               of frontal lobe dysfunction, and the characteristic functional
               neuroimaging changes are in posterior hemispheres rather than
               frontal lobes. We explored this anomaly through a comparison of
               working memory, attention and executive test performance in
               patients with AD (a 'typical' early-onset group with deficits in
               memory, language and perceptuospatial function and an 'amnesic'
               group) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Typical-AD and FTD
               patients both showed impaired performance, whereas amnesic-AD
               patients performed well. Despite similar quantitative performance
               measures, typical-AD and FTD patients showed qualitatively
               distinct performance profiles. Impairments in FTD patients were
               interpreted in 'frontal' executive terms as deficits in

               performance appeared to be influenced by information load and was
               interpreted in terms of working memory capacity. In keeping with
               these different interpretations, neuroimaging showed
               characteristic frontal lobe abnormalities in FTD and
               temporoparietal change in typical-AD. The findings highlight the

               working memory, attention and executive test failures to frontal

               have been widely reported. However, sex-specific effects on rates
               of episodic memory decline remain controversial, and evidence is
               particularly scarce in the oldest-old population. Objective: We
               aimed to investigate sex differences in trajectories of episodic
               memory performance in oldest-old individuals. Methods: Based on
               13-year longitudinal data with 9 follow-up assessments of a large
               sample of cognitively unimpaired old (75+) primary care patients
               ( n = 3,254) participating in the German AgeCoDe/AgeQualiDe
               study, we used linear mixed effects analyses to model
               sex-specific trajectories of change in verbal episodic memory
               while accounting for covarying factors. Results: We found that
               even in the highest age group women outperformed men in immediate
               ( b = –1.71, p Conclusion: Our findings confirm previous research

               tests. We add that this advantage is still present in the
               oldest-old age groups. Our results indicate that sociodemographic

               Study. Linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate changes
               in each continuous cognitive outcome over time by sex. Data
               analysis was completed from March 2019 to October 2020. Exposure:
               Sex. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was change
               in global cognition. Secondary outcomes were change in memory and
               executive function. Outcomes were standardized as t scores (mean
               [SD], 50 [10]); a 1-point difference represents a 0.1-SD
               difference in cognition. Results: Among 34 349 participants, 26
               088 who self-reported Black or White race, were free of stroke
               and dementia, and had covariate data at or before the first
               cognitive assessment were included for analysis. Median
               (interquartile range) follow-up was 7.9 (5.3-20.5) years. There
               were 11 775 (44.7\%) men (median [interquartile range] age, 58
               [51-66] years at first cognitive assessment; 2229 [18.9\%] Black)
               and 14 313 women (median [interquartile range] age, 58 [51-67]
               years at first cognitive assessment; 3636 [25.4\%] Black). Women
               had significantly higher baseline performance than men in global
               cognition (2.20 points higher; 95\% CI, 2.04 to 2.35 points; P <
               .001), executive function (2.13 points higher; 95\% CI, 1.98 to
               2.29 points; P < .001), and memory (1.89 points higher; 95\% CI,
               1.72 to 2.06 points; P < .001). Compared with men, women had
               significantly faster declines in global cognition (-0.07 points/y
               faster; 95\% CI, -0.08 to -0.05 points/y; P < .001) and executive
               function (-0.06 points/y faster; 95\% CI, -0.07 to -0.05
               points/y; P < .001). Men and women had similar declines in memory
               (-0.004 points/y faster; 95\% CI, -0.023 to 0.014; P = .61).
               Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this cohort study
               suggest that women may have greater cognitive reserve but faster
               cognitive decline than men, which could contribute to sex
               differences in late-life dementia.",

               for developing dementia are unclear. Although studies implicate
               sex differences in the effect of stress on cognitive functioning,
               whether stressful life events are associated with subsequent
               cognitive decline has received scant research attention. METHODS:
               In Wave 3 (1993-1996) of the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment
               Area study, 337 men and 572 women (mean age = 47 years) reported
               recent (within the last year) and remote (from 1981 until 1 year
               ago) traumatic events (eg, combat) and stressful life events (eg,
               divorce/separation). At Waves 3 and 4 (2004-2005), they completed
               the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and a word-list memory
               test. Multivariable models were used to examine the association
               between traumatic and stressful life events at Wave 3 and
               cognitive change by Wave 4. RESULTS: A greater number of recent
               stressful life events at Wave 3, but not of more remote stressful
               events, was associated with greater verbal memory decline by Wave
               4 in women but not in men. Stressful events were not associated
               with change in MMSE, and there were no associations between
               traumatic events occurring at any time and subsequent memory or
               MMSE decline in either sex. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike men, middle-aged
               women with a greater number of recent stressful life events
               demonstrate memory decline over a decade later. Sex differences
               in cognitive vulnerability to stressful life events may underlie
               women's increased risk of memory impairment in late life,
               suggesting that stress reduction interventions may help prevent
               cognitive decline in women.",

               decline and incident dementia among middle-aged and older US
               adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Health and
               Retirement Study (HRS) is a prospective cohort study conducted
               biennially among US adults older than 50 years. Data from the HRS
               from calendar years 1996 to 2020 were analyzed from July 1 to 31,
               2023. The final sample included 8082 participants with complete
               data of interest. Exposures: Wealth status was quantified with
               questionnaires. Negative wealth shock was defined as a loss of
               75\% or more in total wealth over a 2-year period. Asset poverty
               was defined as zero or less total net wealth. Main Outcomes and
               Measures: Cognitive function was assessed with the modified
               Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS-m). Dementia
               status was determined with TICS-m scores and proxy assessment.

               (IQR, 7-20) years. Compared with participants who had positive
               wealth without shock, those with negative wealth shock had
               accelerated cognitive decline (β coefficient, -0.014 [95\% CI,

               (hazard ratio [HR], 1.27 [95\% CI, 1.11-1.46]; P < .001). Higher
               dementia risks were also found in participants with asset poverty
               at baseline (HR, 1.61 [95\% CI, 1.30-2.00]; P < .001).
